Adding more space will simply be more space. Cyclists definitely need to be better protected on the A56 but even doubling capacity would still not justify the need for a dedicated lane bigger than the current one. I would welcome the low/stubby barriers (as per Talbot Rd in Stretford) as that gives cyclist protection but doesn't remove a full lane. This is only possible on certain sections though like near TGI Fridays. Further back for example, Washway Rd is busy and losing a lane would be chaotic for motorised traffic. \nIf this is to help the environment then the best thing to do there is allow cars/vans etc through without increased delay as they will emit less CO2 than they will standing still.\n\nIn short, please don't reduce motorised traffic capacity on the A56. Please look to add a physical low barrier by the existing cycle lanes to protect the cyclists. Please consider 'some' loss of pavement where suitable (by TGI Fridays it is rarely used).
