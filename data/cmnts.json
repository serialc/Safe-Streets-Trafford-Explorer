This is a reaction to the Coronavirus situation but I think this is the wrong reaction now. I get the reduction in public transport for a period. With lockdown being wound back I think this reaction is now too late to be implemented, I applaud the need to protect cyclists, however, reduction of lanes to make them more suitable for cyclists will increase motorised traffic and more traffic jams (which possibly endangers them more). <br><br>Not everyone is willing or able to cycle to work and I fall into that category. <br><br>Bicycles are often used here but there can be minutes between them. Adding more space will simply be more space. Cyclists definitely need to be better protected on the A56 but even doubling capacity would still not justify the need for a dedicated lane bigger than the current one. I would welcome the low/stubby barriers (as per Talbot Rd in Stretford) as that gives cyclist protection but doesn't remove a full lane. This is only possible on certain sections though like near TGI Fridays. Further back for example, Washway Rd is busy and losing a lane would be chaotic for motorised traffic. <br>If this is to help the environment then the best thing to do there is allow cars/vans etc through without increased delay as they will emit less CO2 than they will standing still.<br><br>In short, please don't reduce motorised traffic capacity on the A56. Please look to add a physical low barrier by the existing cycle lanes to protect the cyclists. Please consider 'some' loss of pavement where suitable (by TGI Fridays it is rarely used). Please don't take Washway Rd down to less than 2 lanes.<br><br>Reduction in throughput will cause more traffic jams.","abdate":"2020-05-26"},"707":{"title":"Narrow pavement on corner outside The Block & Gasket","cid":"5ecd1bb1035e28a47be3446f","feeling":50,"consent":true,"subdate":"22 days ago","votes":6,"url":"https://safestreetstrafford.commonplace.is/comments/5ecd1bb1035e28a47be3446f","lat":53.4247948523835,"long":-2.32025027275085,"wantperm":"Yes","issues":"Not able to maintain 2m distance from others","solutions":"Extend pavement_,_More space to walk","comment":"Narrow pavement on the corner outside The Block & Gasket, and a bit of a bottleneck with some people waiting to use the pedestrian crossing, and others continuing round to the school for example.

Modified cars drag racing of an evening is a regular occurance (I'm told that the speed camera vans do not operate later than 3pm!), motorcyclists wheelying down the road, excessive speed, road rage (especially as two lanes become one). There are extensive cycle routes on both sides but the signage isn't quite enough to encourage some cyclists to use then, preferring to use the main carriageway or the pavement. The road speed has been wrongly classified. 40mph is used on roads at the edge of a connerbation. Shaftesbury Road is not at the edge of a connerbation. It might have been 30 or 40 years ago when the road as classified but it isn't now. The dual carriageway feel of this road encourages speeding. the straightness of this road encourages excessive speed, the lack of road markings encourages speeding. With single carriageways at either end, having a dual carriageway effect, in the middle, does nothing to reduce traffic at peak times. It justs moves the problem...in this case onto the access roads at either side, which endangers school children and members of the public. The road could be redesigned with a chicane style central reservation, to slow traffic, one way grates at the beginning of the access roads (yes, it would inconvenience the residents but no more than having cars travelling in excess of 40mph down an access road).

If, God willing, people quickly get back to work, then because we are being told to avoid public transport, there will be gridlock on the roads being restricted just like there was when the Edge Lane/Chester Road junction was being developed. All the money spent putting two right turn lanes onto the Chorlton bound Edge Lane has now been wasted. Two lanes into one. You do the maths. God forbid it is made permanent.

It\u2019s upto people to be more responsible about their own social distancing and walk nearer the far side of the pavement away from the traffic and if other people are passing the opposite way to watch for cyclists and find a safe way to do so as this sort of thing will happen all the tome now & we just have to find a way to personally deal with it or if you feel unsafe it\u2019s very simple wear a mask dont expect the council to spend thousands on a new road system that will cause massive headaches for locals and also see surrounding quieter roads become more busy because of motorists using back roads to access the motor.","abdate":"2020-06-11"},"1319":{"title":"Ludicrous cone usage is only hugely increasing pollution ","cid":"5ee265655f8eb181bb3cc1e3","feeling":0,"consent":false,"subdate":"6 days ago","votes":0,"url":"https://safestreetstrafford.commonplace.is/comments/5ee265655f8eb181bb3cc1e3","lat":53.4234133557535,"long":-2.32771964991116,"wantperm":"No","issues":"Volumes of traffic","solutions":"Remove cones ","comment":"What a ridiculous idea  causing huge increases in pollution and congestion with absolutely no benefit.

Trafford council has proposed and confirmed the splitting of Barrington Rd to all motorised vehicles at the Sandiway Rd/Gaskell Rd junction.<br>As a local resident to this road junction, I whole heartedly agree with and support this positive action.<br>Having made the above support clear to you, I feel it necessary to highlight some concerns I have regarding the impact this road closure will have on the surrounding area, and I seek to make suggestions in lieu of these where possible.<br>First, the main goal of this closure appears to relate to the large numbers of cars using Barrington Rd as a short cut through to Altrincham Interchange \u2013 as stated in the letter circulated to local residents dated 5th June 2020 but not received until 11th June 2020. It would be amiss not to point out that there are multiple other routes (illustrated in the attached figure) to which traffic may take in order to simply circumvent the traffic lights on the A56, by the Best Western Cresta Court. <br>Route 1 starts at the navigation Rd traffic lights, moves down Navigation Rd, turns right onto Hawarden Rd, onto Gaskell Rd, and ends up left onto Barrington Rd. Route 2 and 3 follow in much a similar manner, starting by either turning left from the A56 onto Gladstone Rd or Harcourt Rd, and right on to Hawarden Rd, or the A56 turning onto Barrington Rd, moving to Ellesmere Rd, and then right at Gaskell Rd. Route 4, which appears to be the most hotly debated route among online articles, involves turning onto Sandiway Rd, then right onto Burlington Rd, and left onto the A560. Route 5, though not missing the traffic lights the Best Western Cresta Court, does miss the Barrington Rd A560 junction by moving down Victoria St.<br>Route 1 \u2013 Issues include the Navigation Primary School, Navigation Recreational Ground, multiple crossroad junctions, main route to the Navigation Rd train/Metrolink station, and carpark. Ends Up on Barrington Rd or Grosvenor Rd.<br>Route 2 \u2013 Issues include Navigation Primary School and multiple crossroads. Ends up on Barrington Rd or Grosvenor Rd.<br>Route 3 \u2013 Issues include Navigation Primary School traffic and parking. Ends up on Barrington Rd or Grosvenor Rd.<br>Route 4 \u2013 Issues include designated conservation area, and increased traffic down Burlington Rd, where speeding cars are a regular occurrence. Incidentally access through Barrington Rd prior to Sandiway Rd may encourage speeding due to the Sandiway Rd/Gaskell Rd junction being turned into a corner.<br>Route 5 \u2013 Issues with diverted traffic down Victoria Rd possibly negating the impact intended from the previously blocked off Springfield Rd.<br>In order to promote cycling and walking, traffic must be slowed down on other viable routes, such as the ones listed above, stopping the development of new \u201crat runs\u201d. These measures are necessary as evidenced through the recent cycling accidents and fatalities occurring near the National Trust Property of Dunham Massey. By not making these connected streets safe, residents may feel the only safe way to transport children or themselves to school or into Altrincham town centre will be via motorised vehicle. I urge the council to consult or employ a professional to look at these routes and the surrounding areas, in order to recommend viable strategies to slow down traffic on these roads (speed bumps, one way systems, reduced speed limits, blocked off streets).<br>As a separate but linked concern, I would also like to bring your attention to the mounting pressure on the A56, and the shameful lack of safe pedestrian crossings between Devonshire Rd near the Navigation Rd junction, and the petrol station near Loretto Preparatory School. Residents either side of the A56, including those on Sandiway Rd, Burlington Rd and Oldfield Rd, are consistently risking life and limb in the simple act of crossing the A56. I must point out that as the A56 transitions to dual carriageway, vehicle speeds also increase. Like Burlington Rd, speeding is an issue on this section of the A56, and this must also be addressed when blocking Barrington Rd, as increased traffic on the A56 may lead to a greater number of speed related accidents. I would like to see two additional crossings for pedestrians implemented in the near future, one linking the Cresta Court to St George C of E Church \u2013 the current system does not provide a safe space or sufficient time for residents to cross \u2013 and one close to the Oldfield Rd/A56 bend near The Mount John Leigh Park entrance, which will help to slow traffic down and reduce the number of vehicles willing to risk speeding. Perhaps these new pedestrian crossing could also take into account additional cycle lanes at the point of implementation. <br>In summary, I support the positive action the council is currently undertaking to reduce vehicle use in Altrincham, however the impact of the Barrington Rd closure on roads in the immediate vicinity urgently needs to be considered and addressed. Longstanding issues relating to the Altrincham section of the A56 also need to be addressed with the same urgency.<br>","abdate":"2020-06-12"},"1342":{"title":"Reducing traffic ","cid":"5ee46f5ab6f55538d1306272","feeling":0,"consent":true,"subdate":"4 days ago","votes":2,"url":"https://safestreetstrafford.commonplace.is/comments/5ee46f5ab6f55538d1306272","lat":53.4235161430265,"long":-2.32756252409672,"wantperm":"Yes","issues":"Volumes of traffic","solutions":"Slow down traffic_,_Better crossings_,_More space to cycle_,_Less parking","comment":"Brilliant use of cones to create more space for cycling.

Business owners are incredibly short-sighted not understanding that many local residents (there are literally thousands within very easy walking distance) are being put off visiting the village because of the inconsiderate drivers and business owners pandering to their appalling trashy bad manners. I'll leave aside the PM2.5 particles that are infiltrating EVERY organ in our bodies and take slight comfort from the fact that the filters on even the most expensive cars do not filter these. Its just sad to see ignorant parents sitting with engines running poisoning their children in the passenger seats. Chris Boardman often quotes that a third of all car journeys in Gtr Mcr are of less than 1km (250 million per year!). I am a proud Mancunian but am now thorougly embarrassed of where I live, embarrassed of the selfish and ignorant behaviour, embarrassed that we are so pathetic. I find it difficult to understand why people can't walk for 10-15 minutes rather than get in a car given the global environmental issues we are facing. The local authority must change the environment as this is the only way to promote a change in behaviour. Please get on with it, upset a few car drivers and quickly move on. Local businesses seem to have no idea that removing the volume of cars to promote considerate and sociable walking and cycling would transform the village and lead to a huge increase in footfall. There is plenty of evidence elsewhere to support this. Sad to say - as a local resident - I would rather the village die in its current form in order to see it become something much better for thousands of local residents and decent businesses. Personally, I will continue to walk into Altrincham. I will leave Hale to serve the car drivers who want to drive up and down the street waiting for a parking spot on the pavement right outside where they want to get their coffee or sugar fix.
